Despite his efforts, however, she routinely overhears him or others making disparaging comments about her bread, resulting in a running gag through the series being Akio's attempts to reassure her of her baking skills. She gets very upset when customers are not satisfied with her bread. Sanae is normally depicted as being delicate and emotional, but is actually very strong-willed and determined.</td>

Her main hobby is fortune-telling, although her success at it tends to be very limited. She shows affection for Tomoya, and her sister goes through various exploits in an attempt to foment romance. Kyou's growing endearment towards Tomoya, however, is at Ryou's expense. The competing affections of the Fujibayashi twins serves as the plot for the Another World: Kyou Chapter OVA.</td>

Like Tomoya, he is well-known as a delinquent, and even his signature blond hair is a clue to his anti-establishment personality. Though primarily serving as comic relief, Youhei maintains a consistent role throughout the story. His player attitude leads him to consistent run-ins with other characters: his introduction scene shows him being beaten up by the Rugby Club, and he is frequently the victim of Tomoyo's chain-kicks. He and his sister, Mei Sunohara, are the focus of the first episodes of ~After Story~. He also appears later in ~After Story~ without his blond hair.</td>

These rumors initially hamper her ambition of becoming president of the Student Council; however, she eventually achieves this goal with the help of Tomoya and Youhei.
